## EducOnto and EduKG: An Ontology and a Knowledge Graph for Higher Education

*Nicolas Hubert, Armelle Brun, Davy Monticolo*

<br>

EducOnto and EduKG are respectively an ontology and a knowledge graph rooted in the field of higher education.
- EducOnto aims at modelling students' profiles, curricula and other relevant concepts.
- EduKG is an instantiation of EducOnto with students' and curricula's information.

### Abstract

Education is a highly complex domain in which students must make their decisions carefully. To model the intricacies of the educational domain, ontologies have successfully been leveraged. However, there is no ontology related to the transition from high school to higher education. This is unfortunate, as this is a critical step in students' academic paths. Beyond this, education in general is a high stakes domain that requires further considerations. Explainability is one of them: recommending an academic path, for instance, must be justified in order to establish trust and convince students. Nevertheless, there is no benchmark dataset related to such a worthy goal yet. Considering the aforementioned gaps in the community, the contribution of our work is twofold: firstly, we introduce EducOnto - an ontology that aims at modelling higher education curricula and students' profiles and annotating them with rich semantics. We chose to focus on the transition from high school to higher education as it is a critical domain which remains largely unexplored. The process of building EducOnto is thoroughly explained and we subsequently evaluate it using both human expertise and a task-based approach. Secondly, we introduce EduKG, a new graph dataset instantiated with students and a broad spectrum of curricula. EduKG is built on the basis of EducOnto, from which it inherits the rich semantics and structural constraints. Both EducOnto and EduKG are well documented and publicly available to promote open science and collaboration.
