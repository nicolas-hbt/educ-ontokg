## EducOnto and EduKG: An Ontology and a Knowledge Graph for Higher Education

*Nicolas Hubert, Armelle Brun, Davy Monticolo*

<br>

EducOnto and EduKG are respectively an ontology and a knowledge graph rooted in the field of higher education.
- EducOnto aims at modelling students' profiles, curricula and other relevant concepts.
- EduKG is an instantiation of EducOnto with students' and curricula's information.

### Abstract

Education is a complex domain where students must make their curricula choices carefully. To model the intricacies of the educational domain,
ontologies have successfully been leveraged in the past. However, no available ontology or dataset directly addresses the critical transition from high school to university from a decision-making perspective. Therefore, the contribution of our on-going work is twofold. Firstly, we introduce EducOnto -- an ontology that aims at modeling university curricula and studentsâ€™ profiles. Secondly, we introduce EduKG -- a knowledge graph inheriting the semantics of EducOnto and instantiated with data about French students and curricula.
